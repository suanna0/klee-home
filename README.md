KLEE is a fictional interior design service that critiques the aspirational aesthetics of wealth and the appropriation of elite hobbies. By embodying the visual language of the millennial-targeted brand aesthetics of the 2010s to an absurd extreme, this project critiques the notion of the "dream" home, interrogating how interior design trends shape both personal identity and public performance.

Commercials and music videos were my entry point to the world of time-based media. Videos I made in high school was heavily inspired by the music videos I watched. Seen as shallow attention grabbers, they don’t always have the best reputation in art school. However, reducing such work to a class of sugary-sweet kitsch-ness prevents a lot of interesting conversations from happening.

Work that is believably commercial–adhering to an easily digestible visual language opens the door to a broader audience. It’s really interesting to study brands and see what are the micro-details that make the experience so appealing. I’d like to believe that the awareness of these decisions that manipulate space, time, and image, gives us a discerning eye to the fiscally-motivated media that is presented to us.
